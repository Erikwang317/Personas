                When evaluating an interface, it‚Äôs a good practice to take the targeted users' perspectives. Now let's take a look at this coffeee machine.üëáüëá

                    The coffee machine interface provides a <span class="bold">clear and straightforward</span> process for users to select and brew their desired beverage. The step-by-step instructions on the display guide users through each action, from selecting a drink to placing the coffee pod and cup in the correct locations. The <span class="bold">automatic</span> opening of the coffee holder and the intuitive "Brew" button contribute to a smooth and efficient user experience.                </p>

                    Question 1: Do you think this interface is intuitive enough to navigate through the entire process?
                </h3>
                <p class="interview-repsonse">
                    All users agreed that the interface provides <span class="bold">intuitive and clear</span>instructions. However, the complexity varies depending on the selected beverage. Users opting for coffee found the process more <span class="bold">complicated</span> due to the need to insert coffee pods. And the interface <span class="bold">failed to provide an unambiguous guide</span> on how to close the coffee holder.	
                </p>
                <h3 class="interview-question">
                    Question 2: How do you feel about the double tap design to enter the main menu?
                </h3>
                <p class="interview-repsonse">
                    Two users appreciated the <span class="bold">double-tap</span> feature, noting it helps prevent accidental activation and enhances accessibility. Conversely, one user considered it redundant, suggesting that single-tap or <span class="bold">hover</span> activation would be more efficient.
                </p>
                <h3 class="interview-question">
                    Question 3: How do you like the menu panel? Does it provide all the options you want or more than enough?
                </h3>
                <p class="interview-repsonse">
                    Users generally found the main menu panel <span class="bold">concise</span>, offering a reasonable number of options.  While instructions on everything else are provided, the guidance on closing the coffee holder is <span class="bold">not intuitive</span>, leading to potential misuse and confusion for users.
                </p>
                <h3 class="interview-question">
                    Question 4: If you can make one improvement to this interface, what will it be?
                </h3>   
                <p class="interview-repsonse">
                    All users agreed that the interface should provide clearer instructions on how to close the coffee holder. Attempts to manually push the holder back could lead to <span class="bold">long-term damage</span>. Therefore, explicit guidance on proper closure methods is necessary to prevent misuse.

                Base on the interview results, we drew the following conclusions and made them into two empathy maps
            </h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="bold">empathy maps</span> were created by analyzing common <span class="bold">behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and actions</span> observed during user interviews and testing sessions. By synthesizing these insights, we developed two archetypal personas that reflect the overarching user needs and challenges. Each quadrant of the empathy map‚Äî<span class="bold">"Thinks," "Feels," "Says," and "Does"</span>‚Äîwas filled with patterns identified across multiple users to ensure the personas accurately represent a broad spectrum of real-world interactions with the coffee machine interface.

                From initial hesitation to selecting a beverage and struggling with the <span class="bold">coffee holder mechanism</span>, 
                the storyboard highlights both the machine's usability issues and Sarah‚Äôs challenges.
